Why are open core companies winning? And why will they continue winning into the future? This is a question constantly ask myself as an open-core founder, and enthusiast myself. It was one of the many things I hoped to learn at the just concluded open core summit. And I think I picked up something relevant I’d like to share. But, first let me share one random picture I took to show how much I enjoyed the conference.

Leonardo da Vinci said “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”, and this insight wasn’t any different. It turns out open core companies are winning because of Excellence. It turns out being open source (core) is an implicit commitment to excellence. The desire to build an open alternative to proprietary technologies as always been a mission to build a 10x better version of the product, and make it even 10x accessible to just anyone in the world that needs. Maybe not articulated in this way, but you can see this as the primary driver of many of the most successful open core companies. In open source land, we have no such thing as the [DeWitt Clause](https://cube.dev/blog/dewitt-clause-or-can-you-benchmark-a-database), instead we say bring it on!

Engineers having a problem, analysing the landscape and seeing how much the available tools sucked. Knowing and believing they have the skills to build an even better version, go on to do so, and release the software in the open for everyone to use and even scrutinise. There are so many examples — [David Cramer](https://twitter.com/zeeg) of Sentry, saw how even very well funded companies had products that sucked, even before they went full in as a company, they were already rivalling well funded companies on some dimensions. If you’re like me, who has used [bit.ly](http://bit.ly) before for short-link management, you’d clearly understand I’m bullish about [dub.sh](http://dub.sh) and [Steven](https://twitter.com/steventey). Product obsessed founders driven by excellence are the recipe for success in open source (core) land.

In conclusion, obviously this doesn’t apply to just ALL software products. But in the categories that does matter, I believe it holds true very strongly. Let’s compete by building exceptional products, not by better sales teams thereby ruining the product for us all. But will this continue to hold true into the future? I can’t tell. Actually, nobody can. But it is my hope that as an Industry we continue to hold ourselves accountable to this very high standards. Because open core, source-available, products. Isn’t just an opportunity to distribute your product, but it is a commitment to excellence and being in the true service of your users. 

Let me close, with the wise words of the Legend — [Heather Meeker](https://heathermeeker.com/about-me/), who said “Products drive adoption, not licenses. Users don’t adopt licenses, they adopt software.” Open core, or source-available products aren’t driven by licenses but by excellence. So open core founders, go on and continue against all odds to build great products!

One last image because, why not?
