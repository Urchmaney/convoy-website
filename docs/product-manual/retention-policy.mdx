Convoy supports exporting events to any S3 compatible cold storage.

> **Note:**
> * The retention policies functionality is available only for licensed users.
> * This feature is currently in beta and disabled by default. To enable it, use the environment variable `CONVOY_ENABLE_FEATURE_FLAG=retention-policy` or the CLI flag `--enable-feature-flag=retention-policy`.

## Configuring Retention

### JSON Configuration

You can configure read replicas by adding the `storage_policy` object to your database configuration JSON.

| Key                | Description                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`             | Storage type, either "s3" or "on_prem"                    |
| `s3.prefix`        | Prefix for S3 storage path                                |
| `s3.bucket`        | Name of the S3 bucket                                     |
| `s3.access_key`    | AWS access key for S3 authentication                      |
| `s3.secret_key`    | AWS secret key for S3 authentication                      |
| `s3.region`        | AWS region where the S3 bucket is located                 |
| `s3.session_token` | Temporary session token for AWS authentication (optional) |
| `s3.endpoint`      | Custom endpoint URL for S3-compatible storage             |
| `on_prem.path`     | File system path for on-premises storage location         |

```json using storage policy via JSON configuration
{
  "storage_policy": {
    "type": "s3 | on_prem",
    "s3": {
      "prefix": "<insert-s3-prefix>",
      "bucket": "<insert-s3-bucket>",
      "access_key": "<insert-s3-access-key>",
      "secret_key": "<insert-s3-secret-key>",
      "region": "<insert-s3-region>",
      "session_token": "<insert-s3-session-token>",
      "endpoint": "<insert-s3-endpoint>"
    },
    "on_prem": {
      "path": "<insert-on-prem-path>"
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables Configuration

Alternatively, you can supply environment variables to configure the storage policy.

| Environment Variable               | Description                                               |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `CONVOY_STORAGE_POLICY_TYPE`       | Storage type, either "s3" or "on_prem"                    |
| `CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_PREFIX`        | Prefix for S3 storage path                                |
| `CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_BUCKET`        | Name of the S3 bucket                                     |
| `CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY`    | AWS access key for S3 authentication                      |
| `CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_SECRET_KEY`    | AWS secret key for S3 authentication                      |
| `CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_REGION`        | AWS region where the S3 bucket is located                 |
| `CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` | Temporary session token for AWS authentication (optional) |
| `CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_ENDPOINT`      | Custom endpoint URL for S3-compatible storage             |
| `CONVOY_STORAGE_PREM_PATH`         | File system path for on-premises storage location         |

```shell using storage policy via environment variable configuration
CONVOY_STORAGE_POLICY_TYPE=''
CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_PREFIX=''
CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_BUCKET=''
CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=''
CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_SECRET_KEY=''
CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_REGION=''
CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=''
CONVOY_STORAGE_AWS_ENDPOINT=''
CONVOY_STORAGE_PREM_PATH=''
```

## Retention Using Postgres Partitions
Prior to `Convoy v25.1.1` the job that ran the retention policy carried out two tasks:
- Backing up the webhook event data to S3.
- Running DELETE queries on the tables.

The problem with this approach was that any of these tasks could fail for a number of reasons
- The backup action could fail, making the retention query not run.
- The backup action could succeed, but the retention query would time out.
- Both actions failed

With the new system, the backup and delete operations run in different jobs that are triggered at different times.

## Switching to Partition for Retention
To switch to managing retention using Postgres partitions, you need to run:
```
convoy utils partition
```

To switch back from managing retention using Postgres partitions, you need to run:
```
convoy utils unpartition
```

## Retention Granularity

The previous system also didn't make it possible to specify different retention periods for different projects. Now it is possible to specify different retention periods per project.
This can be managed from the project settings page.
